I start to learn front-end development. There are plenty of differences between traditional webpage editing (such as using Adobe Dreamweaver software to design a webpage). 

The new standards of HTML5 and CSS3 are amazing. These parts are easy , I think. Probablly because I can use photoshop, firework and other Adobe softwares fluentlly.

What's more, it is easy to use css. But using it well isn't an easy task.

### 2018.02

learning basic javascript codes. Basic JS codes are similar to other coding languages. JS is an O-O programming language. The polymorphism isn't obvious. 

ECMAscript, a standard coding plan, is developing rapidly. ES5 is ripe and stable. In 2015, ES6 use class to create an object (from cpp?). And ES6 use string module. It maybe come from Ruby. 

Recentlt some frineds told me that NodeJS could work in desktop application. In one day JS will work every place.

I got a github account. Learning git is an essential step. When I fell asleep, I find that writing and coding could make me patient and calm. 

I find a project, Codecombat. Codecombat is a perfect open-source project. It uses coffeeScript rather than javascript. A little upset => => In this project, people can learn coding including Python, Javascript, Java and other languages. 

Learing coding and English every day!
