This repository is the first trial repository of Michael An.

### 2018.01

I start to learn front-end development. There are plenty of differences between traditional webpage editing (such as using Adobe Dreamweaver software to design a webpage). 

The new standards of HTML5 and CSS3 are amazing. These parts are easy , I think. Probablly because I can use photoshop, firework and other Adobe softwares fluentlly.

What's more, it is easy to use css. But using it well isn't an easy task.

### 2018.02

learning basic javascript codes. Basic JS codes are similar to other coding languages. JS is an O-O programming language. The polymorphism isn't obvious. 

ECMAscript, a standard coding plan, is developing rapidly. ES5 is ripe and stable. In 2015, ES6 use class to create an object (from cpp?). And ES6 use string module. It maybe come from Ruby. 

Recentlt some frineds told me that NodeJS could work in desktop application. In one day JS will work every place.

### 2018.03

I got a github account. Learning git is an essential step. When I fell asleep, I find that writing and coding could make me patient and calm. 

I find a project, Codecombat. Codecombat is a perfect open-source project. It uses coffeeScript rather than javascript. A little upset => => In this project, people can learn coding including Python, Javascript, Java and other languages. 

Learing coding and English every day!

### 2018.04

Read readme.text of data repository. Finish user's information setting in github.

I can make a basic webpage using sublime editor. HTML is the structure of pages, CSS is the style of pages, JS is the magic and action of pages.

Other small JS plug-ins can help me to ease working stress. The fullpage plug-in can make different pages switching fluently. And a small shopping project (similar to JD) and a take-out meal project are finished. 

### 2018.05

laern senior javascript programming. And JS is not easy. Some JS codes are unique. Such as 0.1 plus 0.2 not equal 0.3, however, 0.1 plus 0.5 equal 0.6. And ajax is excellent. Now axios can work well without ajax. 

In the free time, I learn about main structures and MVC or MVVM design modal. (Modal-View-View-Modal). The main structures are Angular, Vue and React. Recently, Angular is too large to design a single page, so people choose React or Vue. And I design three shopping webpages for mobile devices. The pages use different methods to suit different length and height(percentage, flex, rem). Now I should use it fluently.

### 2018.06

Continue learning structue. Using modals can save more time and make codes use widely. Start designing Leisure website and a company fullpage. We have a small team and my main job is to design webpages. And I need to test my codes with others groupnumbers. There are many bugs that we can't realise until testing together. And sometimes designer perfer another color or logo, I need to clip them right away. The jobs are interesting and busy. Tired but happy.

And I learn some chrome inside render methods. There are three engines and each engines can render diferent parts of webpage. There are much knowledge that needs me to learn. As a front-end develper, I have to know Internet basic and data structure.

### 2018.07

I start to learn Mina frame of WeChat small app. I have a personal Wechat Official Platform. In one day, I will design my own small app by myself.

The Mina frame use different programming language, wxml and wxss. Wxml language uses different tags(such as View tag). Wxss use different length, rpx, rather than px or percentage methods. This frame has many useful modules and we can easily use the APIs. However, data tramsfer by using props and state is not easy for me. 

Never stop coding!
